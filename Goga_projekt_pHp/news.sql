(1, 'Shark Attack', 'Why do sharks attack? Sharks are carnivorous and may be found in all seas. Sometimes, they associate humans with food.', 'Surfers are an easy target for sharks, especially in Australia, South Africa and California. Fortunately, there are effective electronic devices that repel sharks by sending electrical pulses designed to keep deadly predators away from wave riders. These anti-shark surf gadgets are detected by its sensory receptors, known as Ampullae of Lorenzini, causing mild-to-intolerable discomfort in the predator. The shark deterrent system may save your life in shark infested waters. You can use the electronic shark defenses in your surf leash or back in the tail of your surfboard.\r\n\r\nSmell, sight, hearing, electroreception and lateral line are the main shark senses. They provide critical information for the activation of protection defenses and attacks. The average shark life expectancy is of between 20 and 30 years, depending on the species. Sharks can reach a swim speed of 20 kilometers per hour (12 miles per hour), when preparing an attack. Great white sharks can even peak at 50 kilometres per hour (31 miles per hour). The most dangerous and deadly species are the great white shark, the tiger shark and the bull shark, but there are over 400 species of sharks. Get details about shark-infested surfing regions. The requiem shark, the sand tiger shark, the black tip shark, the narrow tooth shark, the hammerhead shark, the spinner shark and the blue shark complete the list of the 10 most lethal species of underwater predators. If you sight a shark in the water, first of all, stay as calm as possible. Do not swim or paddle fast to the shore, otherwise you\'ll ignite a shark attack. Track the shark and try to understand if the animal is swimming around or preparing an attack.\r\n\r\nTry to find obstacles, corners, cliffs, rocks, boats or shallow waters. If you\'re scuba diving, make air bubbles. Sharks don\'t enjoy bubbles. Sharks are strong, but they can be beaten. If a shark attacks, defend yourself by hitting the predator in the eyes and gills. There\'s a good chance that he will leave the scene. Finally, swim to the shore. Blood loss should be immediately stopped with clothes, while the medical teams arrive to help you. The International Shark Attack File has been building and updating the largest shark database in the world, with individual investigations of shark attacks worldwide. The fear of sharks is known as galeophobia. Panic, racing heartbeat, nervousness, mental anguish and even dizziness are the most common symptoms when fearing sharks. Shark phobia can only be treated with hypnotherapy and psychotherapy.\r\n\r\nSharks are known for their accurate vision. High contrasts are easily spotted by sharks underwater. Yellow, white and red rash guards and wetsuits are especially visible to sharks, so surfers should avoid them in particularly classic shark-infested waters. Light reflection caused by watches, jewelry or metal gear, should be reduced, too. Dark blue surf gear is always a good option. In response to fatalities caused by sharks, there has been a lot of pressure in shark-infested countries to do something. As a result, many national authorities decided to cull sharks with nets and drum line programs. However, it\'s been proved that these measures are not effective.', '2019-01-18 21:39:35', 'Yes', 'Tiger_shark_1.jpg', 'Tiger shark'),
(2, '5 Things to now when you start surfing', 'From our experience, surfing becomes more fun the more you progress. We know there is a path to accelerate the process of learning to surf and we want to share it with you. Here are the top 5 things we think a beginner/intermediate surfer should know when', '#1 The Learning Curve - Before you start surfing, you must know this: surfing is one of the most difficult and complex sport in the world. Think about it. Not one wave is the same, so your playground is constantly changing. Elements such as wind, tides and swells are affecting the waves you surf differently every single day. Itâ€™s a very challenging and enjoyable learning process. Once you catch your first â€œgreen waveâ€, thatâ€™s it, youâ€™re hooked! Knowing the learning curve helps you prepare your attitude and expectations towards your surfing. Contrarily to snowboarding, for example, thereâ€™s no moment at the 3rd day where you think â€œOk, I got thisâ€ and then very rarely fall again. In surfing, you will wipe-out for years.\r\n\r\n#2 The Importance Of Your Surfboard - In any sport, having the right equipment helps you perform. But surfing is different. It can make the difference between surfing 20 waves or 0 waves in your session. Choosing the right surfboard will completely change the experience. Itâ€™s not about having the â€œbrand new modelâ€. Itâ€™s about having the right volume and rocker. The volume is the measurement of how much flotation the board has. Itâ€™s a function of length, width and thickness. Basically, when you start surfing, you want lots of volume (choose either a longboard or a foamboard, boards that are wide, thick, long and have a flat rocker). Our favourite boards for the first days are 7â€³4 Gnaraloo foamboards, they are very thick and wide, but not too long so the nose doesnâ€™t dive often. We strongly recommend you to ask for advice in a locally owned surf shop. Itâ€™s not just important for the economy; itâ€™s also the best way to get advice from people who know what they are talking about.\r\n\r\n#3 Choose The Adequate Surf Spot - This is extremely important. It can determine whether you have the best time of your life, or the worst. Many surfers will tell you: â€œstart on a beach break, itâ€™s saferâ€. This is true, but only to a certain extent. Of course itâ€™s better to fall on sand then on rocks or coral reef. But the truth is, there are some sandy beach breaks for advanced surfers, and some rocky point breaks for beginner surfers. To make things even more confusing, some spots can be perfect to learn on some days, and on other days only be good for experts. It all depends on the wave conditions. If you want to know if a spot is good for your level, you must not only look up the spot info, but also the daily wave conditions. There are many surf websites and forums loaded with information on surf spots. Our favourite is Surfline.com, because professionals have written it and their info is usually very accurate. As you can see on the right column, they tell you what type of board you need, adequate surf level, tide, swell, bottom, etc. Doing some research on the web is always good. But the best thing is to have knowledgeable and experienced surfers that have been surfing the area for a long time. They are the ones who can really tell you where to go according to your surf level.\r\n\r\n#4 Have Someone To Show You The Basic Technique - As seen on point #1, surfing is one of the most complex and technical sports in the world. Imagine learning the wrong basic techniques and then having to â€œunlearnâ€ your bad habits before you can continue your progression. Trust us, this advice comes from inland surfers that started to dedicate their life to surf way too late in their life. Still today our coaches make us realize weâ€™ve learned certain things the wrong way and itâ€™s very difficult to change old habits. Bottom line is: if youâ€™re serious about learning to surf, learn it the right way. Have an experienced friend or surf coach show you the right basics for the first few days.\r\n\r\n#5 Learn About Surf Ethics - There are many, many rules to go by in surfing: donâ€™t paddle inside, donâ€™t drop in, donâ€™t snake, donâ€™t ditch your surfboard, and so on. It may sound like Chinese when you are new to the sport. Bellow are the top 3 things you should focus on.', '2019-01-18 21:53:13', 'Yes', 'Main2.jpg', 'Just start and wait no more!'),
(3, 'Top 5 Best Beaches for Beginners to Learn To Surf in Bali', 'Bali is often considered one of the ultimate playgrounds for surfers. While the island is mostly famous because of its expert surf spots, Bali also has surf spots for beginners where novice surfers can safely learn surf basics.', 'Before you start reading our top 5, make sure to understand that what makes a surf spot “suitable” for beginners is both the surf spot itself, plus the surf conditions on the specific day you surf at. When the waves get big, it can get a bit hard to find a suitable wave for beginners and intermediates. When joining Bali Surf Camp, our team of professional surf guides will be taking all of these factors in consideration and making sure you are surfing the best waves for your level everyday. But if you are travelling on your own make sure you take a look at surf forecasts and choose the right surf spot in Bali according to the daily surf conditions. If you have very limited experience, you might want to ask for help from more experienced surfers, or join a surf camp in order to have a more pleasant and safe experience.\r\n\r\n#1 Kuta Beach - More than 8 Km long, Kuta Beach should be your first stop if you are jumping on a surfboard for the first time in Bali. Separated in 3 main areas (Kuta Beach, Legian Beach & Seminyak Beach) this beach offers many different spots. This is the safest and more adapted beach for beginner surfers.  Unlike most of the surf spots in Bali, it is a sand bottom beach. Since Kuta is the most popular beach on the island, it is easy to find boards for rent and surf teachers directly on the beach.\r\n\r\n#2 Old Man’s - Batubolong Beach (also called “Old Man’s”), is about 25 minutes North from Kuta on the West Coast. It’s considered part of the surf village of Canggu. This beach is another great option for beginner and intermediate surfers. With a fairly flat, reef bottom contour, this spot typically offers medium sized, soft longboard waves that tend to break and reform several times. This helps spread the crowds and give everyone the chance of getting some waves.\r\nLocal boys offer an impressive collection of boards for rent directly in the parking lot in front of the spot. Foam boards, longboards, single fins, twin fish, this is your chance to try them all for 50K (5$) / session. After an afternoon session, you might want to finish this the right way and join the local expat community for a beer or two for sunset at Old Man’s Bar, where they offer 2 for 1 on drinks every day from 5 to 6.\r\n\r\n#3 Nusa Lembongan - Nusa Lembongan is a little island located West of Bali. It is by far our favourite place to surf around Bali, one we always look forward to visit during our 12 & 18-day Bali Surf Trips. Only a 25-minute boat ride from the coast of Sanur, this little paradise is still quiet and the surf spots are half as crowded as the spots in Bali. Surf spots are on the North side of the island, facing Bali. This position makes it harder for swells to penetrate the area, so the surf is always smaller on Nusa Lembongan than on the island of Bali. This makes it a great option for beginner surfers. The reef breaks on Nusa Lembongan are very tide-sensitive and they offer a very different scene on small or big wave days. We recommend beginner and intermediate surfers to be guided by local instructors like the boys from New Bro when heading out on the spots in Lembongan. Crystal-clear waters, mechanical waves with easy paddle back through the channels, boat rides to the spots, an outstanding view on Bali’s volcanoes, everything is there for an absolute magical surf experience.\r\n\r\n#4 Bingin - Bingin is a crystal-clear water surf paradise. Before heading to this spot, it is important to understand that this spot is VERY tide sensitive. This spot is only suitable for advanced surfers on the low tide. When the waves are small and the tide is high, the wave breaks very softly and offers both a right and left. High tide can be perfect for long boarders, beginners & intermediate surfers. Make sure to always ask local surfers if the timing is good for you to head out. We recommend unexperienced surfers to always be guided by instructors when surfing reef breaks like Bingin.', '2019-01-18 21:42:52', 'Yes', 'kuta-beach.jpeg', 'Kuta Beach'),
(4, 'The surfing boards list', 'Surfing is not a complicated sport. Unlike many other water sports, the truth is that surfing only requires a surfboard and someone willing to glide over the ocean waves.', 'There are several types of surfboards for different wave conditions, and experience levels.\r\n\r\nThe Shortboard - The shortboard is the classic surfboard born out of the so-called shortboard revolution, when Bob McTavish, Nat Young, and Dick Brewer radically transformed the 9\'6\'\' longboards into 6\'6\'\' surfboards. Shortboards are the most popular surfboard template in the world right now. If you visit a popular surfing beach, you\'ll find out that 95 percent of the surfers are riding boards between 5\'5\'\' and 6\'5\'\'. A shortboard can be difficult to paddle, but it is easier to duck dive comparing with a longboard. Shortboards are also easier to turn and will respond quickly in critical moments and sections of the wave. The most common fin setup used in shortboards is the thruster (tri-fin) system.\r\n\r\nThe Longboard - The first surfboard of the modern era was a longboard. As the name suggests, longboards are long surfboards. Longboards are typically over 9\', feature a rounded or blunt nose, plenty of forward width, and wide tails. Longboards have a lot of foam volume and are highly buoyant. As a result, they\'re easy to paddle and will enter any wave quickly. The longboard is the perfect craft for small surf because they plane very well in sloppy, summer waves. Longboards are quite stable and can be ridden on the nose, but they\'re difficult and slow to turn. However, they reflect a tradition, a style, and a statement in the history of surfing.\r\n\r\nThe Fish - Fish surfboards are similar to shortboards, but they tend to be wider from nose to tail, and smaller in length. Because of their width and low rocker, they plane better and generate a lot of speed in small-to-medium waves. The fish model was designed by Steve Lis, a kneeboarder from San Diego, in 1967. These small and fast surfboards also feature a fish-inspired tail and are frequently ridden with a twin-fin setup. One of the most popular fish models is the 1980 Retro Twin Fin by Mark Richards, a magic contest surfboard that helped the Australian win four world titles between 1979 and 1983.\r\n\r\nThe Malibu/Funboard - A malibu, also known as funboard, is a blend between a longboard and a shortboard. They are a favorite type of board between beginners and heavier surfers, but they can also be a backup option for experienced riders who enjoy having fun in small summer conditions. Malibus typically range from 6\' to 8\', and are forgiving boards in ankle-to-waist high waves.\r\n\r\nThe Gun - Guns are large shortboards shaped for extreme surfing conditions. Big wave surfing pioneer Pat Curren is widely considered the father of the gun. He was one of the first surfers to challenge Waimea Bay, in Hawaii. Big wave guns are quite easy to paddle and will enter fast, big wave quickly but, because they\'re big, they\'re not easy to turn. They usually feature a pintail, and the length varies from 7\' to 12\'. Big wave surfing boards have a narrow nose and are often equipped with a thruster fin setup.', '2019-01-18 21:46:54', 'Yes', 'surfboardtypes.jpg', 'Surfboards'),
(5, ' The World Surf League (WSL) released the full schedule for the 2019 Championship Tour (CT)', 'Surfing is truly a global pursuit, and for those looking to live the endless summer, here is the calendar of 2019 surf events that will ensure that you always have sand between your toes.', 'The pro surfing circuit will feature 11 stops for the men and 10 for the women. And, for the first time in the history of surfing, the CT will award equal prize money for both genders. There are a few surprises in the calendar. The Margaret River Pro continues on tour after being canceled in 2018 due to shark and safety concerns. But it will run later, in May. As a result, Indonesia prepares to welcome the elite men and women surfers. But only with a single event. The Bali Pro follows the competition at Bells Beach. The Brazilian stage continues on the WSL agenda, as well as the Surf Ranch Pro, an event held in Lemoore\'s wave pool. The dates for the Pipe Masters remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Rip Curl and Billabong will be the only global surf companies to sponsor events - the Rip Curl Pro Bells Beach and the Billabong Pipeline Masters. Quiksilver is no longer listed as the main sponsor for the French contest.\r\n\r\n\"We decided to increase the offseason and shift the start of the season from March to April, in order to create a more fan-friendly condensed calendar, and to give surfers time to recover,\" notes Sophie Goldschmidt, CEO of WSL.\r\n\r\nThe top 34 includes 11 Brazilian surfers, eight Australian athletes, four American competitors, four Hawaiian surfers, two French wave riders, and single representatives from South Africa, Tahiti, Japan, Italy, and New Zealand. The men\'s 2019 CT is comprised of the top 22 ranked surfers on the 2018 Championship Tour rankings, the top 10 surfers ranked on the year-end Qualifying Series (QS) rankings, plus two wildcards. \r\n\r\nThe women\'s CT schedule has two big surprises on the line. The US Open of Surfing transitions from a Qualifying Series (QS) event to an elite contest and the Meo Pro Peniche opens up to world\'s best female athletes. The women\'s 2019 CT features the top 10 ranked surfers on the 2018 Championship Tour rankings, the top six surfers ranked on the year-end Qualifying Series (QS) rankings, plus one wildcard.
